This directory contains the box used to mount RFID readers to the doors of
units 11 and 15. The window-side of the box is left open to reduce the
distance from the reader coil to the exterior side of the window. The inward
side of the box is glued to a long strip of acrylic that may be screwed into
the door frame to hold it in place. Exact fit may be ensured by using a heat
gun on the long strip and bending it, allowing the box to be aligned directly
against the window.
